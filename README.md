Description:

DeepSeek-R1 is a first-generation reasoning model trained using large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) to solve complex reasoning tasks across domains such as math, code, and language. The model leverages RL to develop reasoning capabilities, which are further enhanced through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to improve readability and coherence. DeepSeek-R1 achieves state-of-the-art results in various benchmarks and offers both its base models and distilled versions for community use.
